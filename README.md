**Roboflow:** a platform designed to simplify the development of computer vision models for robotics, automation, and related applications. RobotFlow typically focuses on datasets, models, and tools that cater to robotics and computer vision tasks like object detection, segmentation, and classification.

1. Users can download the open-source image dataset from Kaggle and annotate/label these images in Robotflow. Additionally, users can upload video for dataset as well. In the Robotflow, there are auto-label and manually label users can use.
2. After finishing the labeling, we can generate the pre-processing images.

The application is applied on the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit platform
**Jetson nano setup:**

3. We can train the model through Robotflow. However, after downloading the dataset, we'll get the api key and train the model on our side.
4. Go to colab to train the model
